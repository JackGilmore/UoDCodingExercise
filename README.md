## The brief
Write a class that models a deck of cards. This class should provide the following functionality:
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Sort the deck
3. Deal the top card from the deck

You can create and implement other classes if needed.
Your code should be of production quality. Try to follow OOP best practices, think about maintainability, testability, usability and extensibility.
